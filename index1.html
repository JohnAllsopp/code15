<section class="abstract">
<p>The Web has come along way from the document focussed hypertext network it began life as. Almsot from its beginning, developers have been pushing its capabilities, often in ingenious if not entirely safe ways.</p>
<p>In recent times, standards bodies and browser developers have been upping the pace in the development of the underlying technologies of our platform, and there's no one better to give us a sense of where we're at, and more importantly where these technologies are going than Alex Russell, who is part of both the W3C's Technical Architecture Group, and TC39, the committee standardizing JavaScript. Alex will set the scene for Code by asking "what comes next for the Web platform".</p>

				</h3>

			
				<section class=description>
					<h4>Web Components: the future of web dev</h4>
					<p>For years Web developers have hacked up their own controls, using <code>div</code>s and classes and CSS. The results have often been amazing, but the costs have been high. Often poor code quality, a tendency for every developer to roll their own controls.</p>
					<p>But there's a light on the horizon, Web components. This inter-related, but also independently useful set of technologies, like HTML templates and the Shadow DOM enable Web application authors to, in the words the specification, "define widgets with a level of visual richness and interactivity not possible with CSS alone, and ease of composition and reuse not possible with script libraries today."</p>
					<p>In this session, Ryan Seddon gets you up to speed with components, and how you can start using them today.</p>
					<h4>About Ryan Seddon</h4>
<p>Ryan Seddon is a Senior Software Engineer at Zendesk. Hailing from Melbourne Australia, he has an unnatural obsession with JavaScript and the many places it runs. In his spare time he’s either playing basketball, writing for his blog thecssninja.com or committing code to github.</p>

				<section class=description>
					<h4>The declarative power of CSS selectors</h4>
					<p>CSS is at times something of the red headed step-shild of Web technologies, seen as fine for adding a bit of style to Web sites, but not "real programming". Well think again. Beneath its stylish surface beats a powerhours of sophistication, Selectors, which you can use not only with CSS, but to manipulate the DOM as well using querySelector.</p>
<p>In this session, CSS wunderkind Fiona Chan takes us into the little explored world of sophisticated CSS selectors. Your development will never be the same again.</p>
					<h4>About Fiona Chan</h4>
<p>Fiona is a fun size front-end developer who is passionate about web standards and making the web an accessible place for all. Her love for CSS and the web community has led her to co-found SydCSS and being one of the organisers for CSSConf Australia. Previously she's worked at Stubbornella, Bigcommerce, Fairfax Media and a few other digital agencies.</p>

					<h4>The Augmented Web is now a reality</h4>
<p>For a long time Augmented Reality has been imprisoned in the land of the Native Application. But now Web Standards, Browsers, Devices and javascript libraries have matured enough to set AR free, making it possible to create AR that runs using "nothing but a Web Browser". In fact it's not only "possible", it's downright easy and loads of fun too! I'll show you how today, you can easily add AR as an alternative interaction model to any web application you are building and how this will totally change the way you and your users will see and use the web over the next few years.</p>

					<h4>About Rob Manson</h4>
<p>Rob Manson is CEO and co-founder of buildAR.com, the world's leading Augmented Reality Content Management System. Rob is the Chair of the W3C Augmented Web CG and an Invited Expert with the ISO, W3C and the Khronos Group. He is an active evangelist within the global AR and standards communities and he is regularly invited to speak on the topics of the Augmented Web, Augmented Reality, WebRTC and multi-device platforms. Rob's latest book "<a href="http://amazon.com/dp/1782166300" title="Getting Started with WebRTC: Rob Manson: 9781782166306: Amazon.com: Books">Getting started with WebRTC</a>" is now a 5 star hit on Amazon.</p>

				<section class=description>
					<h4>3rd party provider footprint: A publisher's take on controlling 3rd party scripts</h4>

<p>It's almost impossible to find a website anymore that doesn't utilize any kind of embedded widgets such as ads, social plugins or analytics: All of these add-ons are considered 3rd party scripts and promise to increase and benefit publisher's revenue. Publishers don't have much control over the provider's code and inevitable just have to trust their integrity, content security policy, code quality and performance.</p>

<p>Imagine a high-traffic website hosting a Twitter widget: Are publishers aware that a sudden Twitter server outage could potentially bring down their site if the widget is not properly included? </p>

<p>The performance and availability of 3rd party scripts don't have to become a worry for publishers. Barbara's talk will not only outline best practices, tools and tricks on how to sandbox 3rd party scripts but also help the audience understand bottlenecks, determine potential risks, and elaborate on how to measure their performance.</p>

					<h4>About Barbara Bermes</h4>
<p>Barbara has been captivated by the web since the millennium and has always been passionate about its capabilities. After working for web agencies in Germany and Canada, and most recently working as a Senior Architect and Performance Advocate for Canada’s national public radio and television broadcaster (CBC), she joined OANDA as the Product Manager for their Developer Program and API. Barbara is an international speaker and organizer of the Toronto Web Performance Meetup Group.

					<h4>A Device API Safari</h4>
					<p>The Device API is what enables web browsers to appear more "native", giving the browser access to new hardware components that are being created primarily in phones and tablets but on some desktops too. Motion and Orientation are well known features of the API, however there are a plethora of others to play with too.

Let's take a tour through the jungle that is the Device API spec and go looking for some new, interesting features of the API. We'll focus on the ones that will be landing in mainstream browsers soon and that you can play with now in order to explore new interaction methods.

				<section class=description>
<h4>ECMAScript 6: A Better JavaScript for the Ambient Web Era</h4>

<p>We've entered the Ambient Computing Era and JavaScript is its dominant programing language, But a new computing era needs a new and better JavaScript. It's called ECMAScript 6 and it's about to become the new JavaScript standard. Why do we need it? Why did it take so long? What's in it? When can you use it? Answers will be given.</p>

<p>Allen Wirfs-Brock is a Mozilla Research Fellow and the technical editor of ECMA-262, the international standard that defines the JavaScript programming language. He is an expert in dynamic, object-oriented programming languages and their implementation but is also an entrepreneur who founded two successful companies. When he's not working on the evolution of JavaScript, he is thinking and writing about the technical and societal implications of the rapidly emerging Ambient Computing Era.</p>

					<h4>You Don't Know SVG</h4>
					<p>The animated Web has come a long way since JavaScript based animations just a few years ago. Increasingly, developers are taking advantage of CSS transforms, transitions, and animation to bring their interfaces to life. But these sophisticated visualizations and experiences users expect at times need more than JavaScript and this is where SVG comes in. </p>

					<p>In this session Dmitry Baranovskiy shows us how to resurrect our content using Scalable Vector Graphics.</p>

					
				<h4>Dmitry Baranovskiy</h4>
<p>Dmitry started his journey back in 2000 as a back-end developer, then a designer and has now finally settled and accep­ted his fate as a front-end develoepr. Des­pite his deep know­ledge of CSS and HTML, he mainly specializes in JavaScript and is well known as the creator of Raphaël, Snap.SVG as well as other JavaScript libraries. These days he is a Senior Computer Scientist with Adobe.</p>

				<section class=description>
					<h4>Alex Feyerke</h4>
					<p>Just assume for a minute that the technical side of building offline-capable (web) apps was really simple. Because it's getting easier every day, and it's obviously desirable: having a robust, reliable app instead of one that turns into a wonky disappointment when it's disconnected for a moment. But what does building apps offline first mean in terms of interfaces and experiences, in terms of your application's structure? What new things can you do? What problems can you solve? What problems does it cause? Is it too much trouble, or is it the future? A talk about patterns for offline UX, persistent local data, confident wording, pre-empting user needs, conflict resolution and ordering things in lists.

				<section class=description>
					<h4>Embrace the asynchronous</h4>

<p>Embrace the asynchronous: for most of its history, programming has been primarily concerned with serial flows of execution. Only since the ascent of the web have millions of programmers been exposed to, and embraced, event-driven, asynchronous programming.</p>

<p>Programming for the web is reactionary. We respond to events from the user, the network and the browser itself. We're regularly receiving new new asynchronous APIs in our browsers, like Geolocation and IndexedDB.</p>

<p>Node.js takes asynchronous programming to a new level and has tracked the rise of new approaches to managing complex program flows. Callbacks, event emitters and streams form the basis of the Node.js tool-set. JavaScript control-flow libraries are a dime a dozen. More recently we've seen wide adoption of Promises and we are now on the verge of new language primitives in JavaScript itself: generators.</p>

<p>Join Rod Vagg for a deep-dive into event-driven programming with JavaScript and learn to embrace the asynchronous.</p>

					<h4>About Rod Vagg</h4>
					<p>Rod Vagg describes himself as a recovering Java programmer with a passion for JavaScript. Rod has been building software for the web for nearly 15 years and is excited about the modularity and productivity afforded by Node.js for constructing complex and performant web applications.</p>

					<h4>When all you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail</h4>
					<p>JavaScript has come a long way with just two tools: the Object and the Array. This talk introduces some of the new native data structures that are available in modern javascript, with unique and powerful capabilities that allow you to write fast, elegant and expressive code.</p>
					<h4>About Ben Birch</h4>
					<p>Ben is a Tech Lead and Beer Baron at Aconex. He’s spent the first 10 years writing JavaScript frameworks, and is now trying to undo all the damage he's done. By day he builds enterprise apps and by night contributes to several open source projects and playing with whatever the hot-new-thing is. You can sometimes spot Ben up the back at @melbjs, pouring the beers.

				<section class=description>
				<h4>Taking JavaScript out of context</h4>
					<p>The 'this' keyword is one of the most perplexing aspects of JavaScript, but understanding function context needn’t be so intimidating. In this session we’ll examine how ‘this’ works, how to control it, and how to harness its surprising flexibility. Finally, we’ll discuss how we can move beyond ’this’, looking at the ways in which we can write powerful code without it.</p>

				<section class=description>
					<h4>Streaming the Web (it's not what you think)</h4>
					<p>Tim Berners-Lee originally proposed HyperText as a way "to link and access information of various kinds as a web of nodes in which the user can browse at will".  When we look at the web today, it is very easy to see that it has become so much more but also exactly that. As we strive to do more with this "web of nodes" there are certain developmental patterns that allow us to rewire the web to create sophisticated applications that can still be easy to understand.  Streams are one of these development patterns and this talk will walk through how you can use streams both for your benefit and for the benefit of your fellow developers.</p>
					<h4>Damon Oehlman</h4>
					<p>Damon Oehlman is an experienced web and mobile applications developer. He has worked with small and large companies to develop software solutions for desktop, web and most recently mobile devices. Damon currently works on WebRTC at NICTA, as well as numerous of his own open source projects.</p>

				<section class=description>
					<h4>The once and future IndieWeb</h4>
					<p>In the beginning, the Web was a simple thing. A bit of HTML, running on a server you probably had root access to, and maybe even had running under your desk. Fast forward 20 years, and most of the Web's content resides in silos, like Twitter and Facebook and Instagram. Our Web sites have become Tumblrs, or blogs hosted at Wordpress.org.</p>
					<p>But this poses huge challenges for the longevity, integrity, and ultimately ownership of the content we create.</p>
					
					<p>In this presentation, Tantek Çelik, one of the great contributors to the open Web challenges us to re-imagine the "IndieWeb" from long ago.</p>
					<h4>Tantek Çelik</h4>
					<p>Tantek Çelik currently works on Open Web Standards at Mozilla. His extensive history on the Web inludes authoring several key W3C specifications, leading the development efforts on Internet Explorer 5 for the Macintosh, co-founding the Microformats movement, and inventing the now infamous, though vital CSS box model hack.
He continues to advocate for, and work tirelesssly to develop standards and technologies for an open Web.</p>

				</h3>

				<section class=description>
					<h4>Offline First: smarter, faster, better web sites and apps</h4>
<p>HTML5 and related W3C developments over the last few years have introduced numerous valuable features for more application like development. One area where the Web has made significant improvements in recent years is in the ability to work offline, and rely less and less on being always connected to a server side.</p>

<h5>What we'll cover</h5>
<p>In this all day, hands-on workshop, John Allsopp will cover the technologies now available to help your sites and applications work while a user isn't connected to the Web, and better even when they are, including</p>

<ul>
	<li>HTML5 Application Cache for sites that work offline (and faster sites too)</li>
	<li>webstorage (a simple, in-browser database)</li>
	<li>The File API (providing better access to local files, such as images)</li>
	<li>Offline Events</li>
</ul>

<h5>Who's it for</h5>

<p>Front End developers, with at least some exposure to JavaScript (but there's no need to be an expert to take advantage of almost all these features)</p>

<section class="biography">
					<h4>About John Allsopp</h4>

<p>For nearly 20 years John has developed software (such as <a href="http://westciv.com">Style Master CSS editor</a>) and written books (including <a href="http://devwws.com">Developing with Web Standards</a>), courses, tutorials, and articles for web designers and developers, and he's one of the founders of the Web Directions Conferences.</p>

<p>In 2000, he wrote A dao of web design for A List Apart. Described as "A manifesto for anyone working on the web" by Jeremy Keith, and cited as a key inspiration for Responsive Web Design by Ethan Marcotte. It outlined the idea that the Web is its own medium, and we must embrace its characteristics, not decry them as bugs.</p>

<p>John is still as excited about the Web and all things computing as he was when he got his first computer, the venerable TRS-80, a lifetime ago.</p>
