<h1>Code 2015</h1>
<h3>Call for Awesomeness</h3>

<p>Q: Are you awesome?</p>

<p>A: Yes you are! </p>

<p>For more than a decade, one of our goals at Web Directions has been uncovering new talent and we've given hundreds from all over the world the opportunity to take their first steps on stage, and further their career. Many a household name like Nicole Sullivan and Dmitry Baranovskiy got their first significant speaking opportunities on our stage (did you know that OOCSS was first launched at a Web Directions conference?)</p>

<p>This year, we're offering <em>you</em> that opportunity, and most importantly the support you need to make it happen. There's up to ten places at our Code conference open to someone like you. We're offering <em>anyone</em> who submits a proposal some fantastic speaker training and mentoring, as well as  a chance to gain experience and impress your peers on our What Do You Know stage in Sydney and Melbourne.</p>

<h3>So how does it all work?</h3>

<h4>What we're looking for</h4>

<p>First up, we're <em>not</em> looking for general presentation proposals. One of our key points of focus at Web Directions is our editorial process. So make sure your proposal matches what we're looking for.</p>

<p>Code is about programming and development with JavaScript and the Web platform. The conference has two days, with a different focus for each. Here's the Web site for <a href="http://www.webdirections.org/code14/">Code 2014</a>, and <a href="http://www.webdirections.org/code13/">Code 2013</a>, to get a sense of the sort of thing we cover. And a bunch of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD01Uub27Sw9s910wexAal3Ak7JWhWAhe">videos from past code events is here</a>. </p>

<p>One day is all about JavaScript, the language. For this day we're looking for highly focussed, 20 minute presentations on language features, particularly ES6 features that can be used today (perhaps via transpilation). What features of the language do you think bring the most value? Which are overlooked? Remember the key is focusâ€“look at one thing well and in detail. A great example is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRm-h6vcpxs&amp;index=5&amp;list=PLD01Uub27Sw9s910wexAal3Ak7JWhWAhe">this presentation by Mark Dalgleish on IIFEs and Closures</a>. It;s hyper focussed, and goes into consdieravlr </p>

<p>The other day focusses more on the Web platform and its features. In particular new features like Service Worker, Device APIs, Web Performance APIs, Web Storage and Web manifests. Again a key criteria is that while these features don't have to be supported on every browser or platform, they should be at least on the track to standardisation and wide spread usefulness and adoption.</p>

<h4>Who are we looking for?</h4>

<p>You! OK, so a bit more detail. We may know you well, or you may never have spoken in public before. Provided the thought of speaking in front of an audience doesn't paralyse you (or maybe it does, and you're willing to work hard to overcome this), then we want you. If you're not particularly experienced, then we'll be giving you the chance to work on your presentation and skills with professional mentors.</p>

<p>You'll be from Australia (we're bringing an number of international experts to speak at Code, but really want to make sure we help develop Australia's talent, as we have been doing since we started).</p>

<p>You'll know your area well, with real world experience, and have the ability to answer questions from your peers about its use, value and shortcomings.</p>

<p>But above all, you'll be excited to share your knowledge with your peers.</p>

<h4>Got it, so what do I have to <em>do</em>?</h4>

<p>There's just a couple of steps to follow. Please do pay close attention, as we want you to get the best possible chance.</p>

<p>Step 1: provide a session title and one or two paragraph description. You may find <a href="http://rmurphey.com/blog/2015/01/26/writing-conference-proposals">this recent post from Rebecca Murphy</a> helpful, as <a href="http://weareallaweso.me/for_speakers/how-to-write-a-compelling-proposal.html">well as these resources</a>, and <a href="http://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi/conference-speaking.html">these resources</a>.</p>

<p>Then submit it to us before April 21 here (don't email it, please use the form!)[action: google form]</p>

<p>Step 2: anyone who provides a genuine proposal will be able to attend a professionally run presentation/speaking workshop to be held in Sydney and Melbourne in late April [action: get dates - Sydney our office, Melbourne Henley Club?] [action: talk to steve about who runs those sessions?]</p>

<p>Step 3: from the submitted proposals we'll choose 10 to be presented in Sydney, and 10 at the Melbourne at our upcoming What Do you Know events in early May. [action: decide dates]. What do You Know is an evening of 5 minute presentations on something the speaker knows well, so you won't get to do your entire presentation, but a part of it, or an briefer overview.</p>

<p>We won't necessarily only choose the final presentation from those at What Do You Know, but it won't hurt your chances. See our FAQ if you can't make it to Sydney or Melbourne.</p>

<p>Step 4: We'll let you know whether you'll be speaking at Code. If you are, then you're a speaker, like any other. You'll be in the program, at the speaker dinner, and of course on the stage. If you're from out of town we'll fly you there, put you up in a hotel, and all in all look after you really well, like we do all our speakers.</p>

<p>And if <em>this</em> time you don't make the program, there's every chance it's more to do with the program balance than it is to do with you. You're now on our radar, you've got some great experience, and we hold multiple events a year, where we're looking for speakers.</p>

<h4>FAQ</h4>

<h4>I've spoken at Web Directions before, can I submit a proposal?</h4>

<p>Yes please!</p>

<h4>I've never spoken before anywhere, should I bother submitting?</h4>

<p>Yes indeed. Remember everyone who submits a proposal gets to come to a professionally run workshop to help you improve your presentation skills.</p>

<h4>I'm not from Sydney or Melbourne, will I be at a disadvantage?</h4>

<p>We'd love to come hold the speaker workshops and a What Do You Know in more cities, but for our first go at this (we plan to take this approach again for future events we hold) we're sticking to where we know best. If you can make your way to Melbourne or Sydney, there's a place for you at the workshop.</p>

<p>If we like your abstract, there's also a good chance we'll invite you to speak at WDYK, but you'll have to get yourself ot Sydney or Melbourne.</p>

<p>This is all a bit new, and we're really trying to work out how to best strike the balance between choosing solely based on our knowledge of a speaker and their experience (what we've traditionally done) and choosing solely based on a proposal (how conferences with Calls For Proposals work).</p>

<p>Rest assured, we'll work hard to not overly privilege Sydney and Melbourne.</p>
