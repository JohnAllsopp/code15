<h2>We Want You!</h2>

<h3>TL;DR</h3>


<p>We're offering 10 people the chance to speak on JavaScript and the Web Platform at our Code Conference, in Melbourne June 25 and 26th 2015</p>

<p>Anyone who submits a proposal that meets our <a href="#guidelines">guidelines</a> below will have a place at a professional presentation workshop we're hosting in either Sydney or Melbourne in late April.</p>

<p>Up to 20 folks will have the chance to speak at <a href="http://www.webdirections.org/events/wdyk-sydney-apr2014/">What Do You Know</a> in Sydney or Melbourne in mid May.</p>

<h3>Speak at Web Directions Code '15</h3>

<p>For more than a decade, a key goal of Web Directions has been uncovering new speaking talent, and we've given hundreds from all over the world the opportunity to take their first steps on stage, and further their careers. Many a household name like Nicole Sullivan and Dmitry Baranovskiy got their first significant speaking opportunities on our stage (did you know that among many other things, OOCSS was launched at one of our conferences?)</p>

<p>This year, we're offering <em>you</em> that opportunity, and most importantly the support you need to make it happen. There's up to ten places on our Code conference program open to someone like you.</p>

<p>But it gets much better. We're offering <em>anyone</em> who submits a proposal some fantastic speaker training and mentoring, and for up to 20 people, the chance to gain experience and impress your peers on our <strong>What Do You Know</strong> stage in Sydney and Melbourne.</p>

<h3>So how does it all work?</h3>

<h4 id="guidelines">What we're looking for</h4>

<p>First up, we're <em>not</em> looking for general presentation proposals. One of our key points of focus at Web Directions is our editorial process. So make sure your proposal matches what we're looking for.</p>

<p>Our <a href="http://webdirections.org/code15">Code Conference</a> is about programming and development with JavaScript and the Web platform. The conference has two days, with a different focus for each. Here's the Web sites for <a href="http://www.webdirections.org/code14/">Code 2014</a>, and <a href="http://www.webdirections.org/code13/">Code 2013</a>, to get a sense of the sort of thing we cover. And a bunch of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD01Uub27Sw9s910wexAal3Ak7JWhWAhe">videos from past code events is here</a>.</p>

<h5>Day One: JavaScript</h5>

<p>The first day is all about JavaScript, the language. For day one we're looking for highly focussed, 20 minute presentations on language features, particularly ES6 (and even ES7) features and patterns that can be used today (perhaps via transpilation). What features of the language do you think bring the most value? Which are overlooked? Remember the key is focus–look at one thing well and in detail. A great example is <a href="http://www.webdirections.org/resources/mark-dalgleish-taking-javascript-context/">this presentation by Mark Dalgleish on 'this' in JavaScript</a>. One really useful thing, explored in detail.</p>

<h5>Day  Two: Web Platform Features</h5>

<p>The second day focusses more on the Web platform and its features. In particular new features like Service Worker, Device APIs, Web Performance APIs, Web Storage and Web manifests. Again a key criteria is that while these features don't have to be supported on every browser or platform, they should be at least on the track to standardisation and wide spread usefulness and adoption, perhaps using polyfills, perhaps by progressive enhancement. Here's a great past presentation on the <a href="http://www.webdirections.org/resources/an-introduction-to-the-file-api-video-presentation-from-cameron-mccormack/">File API</a>, from Cameron McCormack, to get a sense of what we're looking for on day 2.</p>

<h4>Who are we looking for?</h4>

<p>So now you know what we're looking for (20 minute, super focussed sessions), but who are we looking for? You! OK, so a bit more detail. We may know you well, or you may never have spoken in public before. Provided the thought of speaking in front of an audience doesn't paralyse you (or maybe it does, and you're willing to work hard to overcome this), then we want you. If you're not particularly experienced, then we'll be giving you the chance to work on your presentation and skills with professional mentors.</p>

<p>You'll be from Australia (we're bringing an number of international experts to speak at Code, but really want to make sure we help develop Australia's talent, as we have been doing since we started).</p>

<p>You'll know your area well, with real world experience, and have the ability to answer questions from your peers about its use, value and shortcomings.</p>

<p>But above all, you'll be excited to share your knowledge with your peers.</p>

<h4>I've got it, so what do I have to <em>do</em>?</h4>

<p>There's just a couple of steps to follow. Please do pay close attention, as we want you to get the best possible chance.</p>

<p>Step 1: provide a session title and a two to three paragraph description. You may find <a href="http://rmurphey.com/blog/2015/01/26/writing-conference-proposals">this recent post from Rebecca Murphy</a> helpful, as <a href="http://weareallaweso.me/for_speakers/how-to-write-a-compelling-proposal.html">well as these resources</a>, and <a href="http://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi/conference-speaking.html">these resources</a>.</p>

<p>Then submit it to us before April 24 <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/webdirections.org/forms/d/1e-va2O1pLmX0B5mpUjHs8XXqNWHsWRRnI2l2ijHkN6Q/viewform">using this form</a> (don't email it, please use the form!)</p>

<p>Step 2: anyone who provides a genuine proposal that meets our guidelines will be able to attend a professionally run presentation/speaking workshop to be held in Sydney and Melbourne in late April.</p>

<p>Step 3: from the submitted proposals we'll choose 10 to be presented in Sydney, and 10 at the Melbourne at our upcoming What Do you Know events in early May. <a href="http://www.webdirections.org/events/wdyk-sydney-apr2014/">What do You Know</a> is an evening of 5 minute presentations on something the speaker knows well, so you won't get to do your entire presentation, but a part of it, or a briefer overview.</p>

<p>We won't necessarily only choose the conference presentations from those at What Do You Know, but it won't hurt your chances. See our <a href="#faq">FAQ</a> if you can't make it to Sydney or Melbourne.</p>

<p>Step 4: About 5 weeks before the conference we'll let you know whether you'll be speaking at Code. If you are, then you're a speaker, like any other. You'll be in the program, at the speaker dinner, and of course on the stage. If you're from out of town we'll fly you there, put you up in a nice hotel, and all in all look after you really well, like we do all our speakers.</p>

<p>And if <em>this</em> time you don't make the program, there's every chance it's more to do with the program balance than it is to do with you. You're now on our radar, you've got some great experience, and we hold multiple events a year, where we're looking for speakers.</p>

<p>Step 5: You speak on the big stage, in front of hundreds of your peers, at the Arts Centre Melbourne on June 25th or 26th.</p>

<h4 id="faq">FAQ</h4>

<h5>How do I submit my proposal?</h5>

<p>Just <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/webdirections.org/forms/d/1e-va2O1pLmX0B5mpUjHs8XXqNWHsWRRnI2l2ijHkN6Q/viewform">use this form</a></p>
<h5>May I submit multiple proposals?</h5>

<p>Yes you may!</p>

<h5>I've spoken at Web Directions before, can I submit a proposal?</h5>

<p>Yes please!</p>

<h5>I've never spoken before anywhere, should I bother submitting?</h5>

<p>Yes indeed. Remember everyone who submits a proposal gets to come to a professionally run workshop to help you improve your presentation skills.</p>

<h5>I'm not from Sydney or Melbourne, will I be at a disadvantage?</h5>

<p>We'd love to come hold the speaker workshops and a What Do You Know in more cities, but for our first go at this (we plan to take this approach again for future events we hold) we're sticking to where we know best. If you can make your way to Melbourne or Sydney, there's a place for you at the workshop.</p>

<p>If we like your abstract, there's also a good chance we'll invite you to speak at WDYK, but you'll have to get yourself to Sydney or Melbourne.</p>

<p>This is all a bit new, and we're really trying to work out how to best strike the balance between choosing solely based on our knowledge of a speaker and their experience (what we've traditionally done) and choosing solely based on a proposal (how conferences with Calls For Proposals work).</p>

<p>Rest assured, we'll work hard to not overly privilege Sydney and Melbourne.</p>
