<h4>What comes next for the Web Platform?</h4>
<p>The Web has come a long way from the document focussed hypertext network it began life as. Almost from its beginning, developers have been pushing its capabilities, often in ingenious if not entirely safe ways.</p>
<p>In recent times, standards bodies and browser developers have been upping the pace in the development of the underlying technologies of our platform, and there's no one better to give us a sense of where we're at, and more importantly where these technologies are going than Alex Russell, who is part of both the W3C's Technical Architecture Group, and TC39, the committee standardizing JavaScript. Alex will set the scene for Code by asking "what comes next for the Web platform".</p>

	<h4>Current best practice in front end ops</h4>

<p>Alex Sexton gave a name to that big part of our life that we Front-End folks didn't previously have a name for–Front-End Ops–the knowledge, techniques and practices we use to make faster Web sites and applications, monitor errors, and build and deploy our work.</p>

<p>But nearly two years on, and with developments like HTTP/2, what's the state of Front-End Ops? Who better to tell us than the guy who came up with the name in the first place?</p>

<h4>Stop the Fanaticism–using the Right Tools for the Job</h4>

<p>When a JavaScript project is defined, we face a seemingly endless number of choices – from frameworks, to module loading, to dependency management, to code style. There are at least 2 tools for every job, and a group of people willing to argue the merits of each one until they are blue in the face. Fanaticism runs rampant, and we've started to ask the wrong questions when faced with new tools and ways of solving problems. This talk examines the decisions we as developers make, the way we make them, and how we can make these decisions better. We'll talk about framework fanaticism, dealing with large teams, and protecting yourself once you've made your choices.</p>

			<section class=description>
<h4>State of the Animation</h4>
<p>The post-Flash era is hardly free of animation. CSS animation is quickly becoming a cornerstone of user-friendly UI frameworks, and JavaScript libraries already exist to handle complex, interactive animations. And now there’s a new API coming to town specifically for web animations! In the wake of so much “CSS vs. JavaScript animation” infighting, you'll be introduced to the Web Animations API via the development styles and insights of four distinct groups of people: UI designers, interaction developers, library authors, and the browser teams implementing it.</p>

			<section class=description>
			<h4>What does HTTP/2 mean for Front End Engineers?</h4>
<p>HTTP/2, the long awaited update to the Web's venerable transfer protocol is now complete, and indeed supported in some browsers and by some servers. But we Front End Engineers don't need to worry about all that low level stuff right? After all it just makes everything faster between the client and server.</p>
<p>Well, it's not quite that simple. In fact there are plenty of things you're likely doing right now, best practices for performance over the network like using sprites, domain sharding, concatentating files and the like that not only won't you have to do with HTTP/2, but which might actually make things worse.</p>
<p>In this presentation we'll learn from the chair of the IETF working group that developed HTTP/2, Mark Nottingham about what HTTP/2 brings, and what you should and shouldn't be doing to get the most performance benefit from it.</p>

			<section class=description>
<h4>Dawn of the Progressive Single Page App</h4>
<p>With the increasing popularity of single page applications, we've seemingly been forced to choose between progressive enhancement and rich, app-like experiences on the Web. Through the power of server-side JavaScript, we now have the ability to share our UI code between client and server, allowing us to get the best of both worlds by pre-rendering on the server. While extremely powerful, this technique only serves to highlight why progressive enhancement continues to be such a vital approach to web development.</p>

<p>After beginning with a refresher course in progressive enhancement, we'll cover the ways in which we can ensure our single page applications remain crawlable, accessible and resilient, even when JavaScript is completely disabled.</p>

	<h2>We want you to speak at Code</h2>
	
<p>For more than a decade, uncovering new talent has been one of our goals here at Web Directions. We have provided the opportunity for hundreds of speakers from all over the world to further their career, by taking their first steps on the speakers stage. Many a household name like Nicole Sullivan and Dmitry Baranovskiy had their first significant speaking opportunities on the Web Directions stage (did you know that OOCSS was launched at a Web Directions conference?)</p>

<p>This year, we're offering <em>you</em> that opportunity, and most importantly providing the support you need to make it happen. There's up to ten places at our Code conference open to someone like you. We're offering anyone who submits a proposal some fantastic speaker training and mentoring, and a chance to gain experience and impress your peers on our What Do You Know stage in Sydney and Melbourne.</p>
