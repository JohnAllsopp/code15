	<h2>What is Code?</h2>

	<p>Code is two day, one track conference, featuring World leading experts in JavaScript and developing for the Web platform. Produced by Web Directions, and curated by John Allsopp, we've got over a decade's experience in professional events for the Web industry, and John has over 20 years experience developing for and writing aboutWeb technologies.</p>

	<h2>Who's it for?</h2>
	
	<p>Code is for professionals and teams developing for the Web platform</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Front end developers and engineers</li>
		<li>Web developers</li>
		<li>engineering managers</li>
		<li>CTOs</li>
	</ul>

	<p>If you build sophisticated stuff for the Web, Code will help you do it better.</p>


	<h2>Why Attend?</h2>

	<p>Keeping up with the constantly evolving Web platform is a full time job. Let it be ours, and not yours.

<section class="abstract">
<p>The Web has come along way from the document focussed hypertext network it began life as. Almsot from its beginning, developers have been pushing its capabilities, often in ingenious if not entirely safe ways.</p>
<p>In recent times, standards bodies and browser developers have been upping the pace in the development of the underlying technologies of our platform, and there's no one better to give us a sense of where we're at, and more importantly where these technologies are going than Alex Russell, who is part of both the W3C's Technical Architecture Group, and TC39, the committee standardizing JavaScript. Alex will set the scene for Code by asking "what comes next for the Web platform".</p>

			</h3>

<section class="abstract">
<p>The post-Flash era is hardly free of animation. CSS animation is quickly becoming a cornerstone of user-friendly UI frameworks, and JavaScript libraries already exist to handle complex, interactive animations. And now there’s a new API coming to town specifically for web animations! In the wake of so much “CSS vs. JavaScript animation” infighting, you'll be introduced to the Web Animations API via the development styles and insights of four distinct groups of people: UI designers, interaction developers, library authors, and the browser teams implementing it.</p>

			</h3>

<section class="abstract">
<p>HTTP/2, the long awaited update to the Web's venerable transfer protocol is now complete, and indeed supported in some browsers and by soem servers. But we Front End Engineers don't need to worry about all that low level stuff right? After all it just makes everything faster between the client and server.</p>
<p>Well, it's not quite that simple. In face there are plenty of things you're likely doing right now, best practices for performance over the newtwork like using sprites, domain sharding, concatentating files and the like that not only won't you have to do with HTTP/2, but which might actually make things worse.</p>
<p>In this presentation we'll learn from the chair of the IETF working group with developed HTTP/2, Mark Nottingham about what HTTP/2 brings, and what you should and shouldn't be doing to get the most performance benefit from it.</p>

			</h3>

<section class="abstract">
<p>Web applications do not require an over-arching framework to be organized and maintainable. In fact, an application with modules from all over the place can in fact be maintainable, understandable, and encouraged. Instead of subscribing to one framework that provides developers with an entire slew of unused or unneeded functionality, an architecture can be built from the ground up using small modules from a variety of different sources.</p>

<p>This kind of architecture is taking off in the Node community, and is starting to make its way in client-side javascript. This talk explores the differences between using a formal framework- like Ember, Backbone, Express, or Sails- and using a modular approach. Frameworks are not entirely out of the picture- there are a few examples of frameworks that encourage this kind of architecture by providing minimal structure in the right places. This talk will explore those frameworks, and the general ideas, benefits, and possible pitfalls of a modular architecture, from both the client and server-side perspective.</p>

			</h3>

<section class="abstract">

<p>With the increasing popularity of single page applications, we've seemingly been forced to choose between progressive enhancement and rich, app-like experiences on the web. Through the power of server-side JavaScript, we now have the ability to share our UI code between client and server, allowing us to get the best of both worlds by pre-rendering on the server. While extremely powerful, this technique only serves to highlight why progressive enhancement continues to be such a vital approach to web development.</p>

<p>After beginning with a refresher course in progressive enhancement, we'll cover the ways in which we can ensure our single page applications remain crawlable, accessible and resilient, even when JavaScript is completely disabled.</p>
