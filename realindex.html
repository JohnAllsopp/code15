<section class="abstract">
	<p>Building responsively allows us to create flexible user interfaces that support the widest possible audience with a single front-end codebase. But in embracing the ever-increasing contexts in which our sites are used, performance and accessibility must remain our highest priorities; we must continually question each code addition, and improve our delivery and application techniques to ensure they’re best serving users’ needs. </p>

	<p>This talk will explore the challenges of creating fast and broadly-accessible websites and offer approaches that dramatically improve performance, usability, access, and sustainability.</p></section>

		<p>In just one day, Andrew will teach you how to:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Use table display properties to rearrange content</li>
			<li>Create cross-browser layouts using Flexible Box Layout (Flexbox)</li>
			<li>Implement magazine-style layouts using CSS3 Shapes </li>

			<li>Make the most of tiny bitmaps with border images</li>
			<li>Use CSS3 filters and blend modes for creative effects</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Required equipment and knowledge</h3>

		<p>This workshop is for professional Web designers and developers and assumes that you’re already familiar with HTML5 and a little CSS. It‘s a good idea to bring your laptop to the workshop. Pencils, markers and paper will be supplied.</p>
